# Building a Basic Chatbot in Python
I'm excited to share a recent project I completed as part of my internship with CodeAlpha. I developed a basic chatbot using Python, showcasing some fundamental concepts and techniques in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to create an interactive chatbot capable of responding to user inputs in a conversational manner. This was achieved using Python, leveraging libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and regex for text processing.

# Key Features
Simple Conversational Flow: The chatbot can handle basic greetings and farewells, and provide predefined responses to common questions.

Keyword Recognition: It identifies specific keywords in user inputs to generate appropriate responses.

Pattern Matching: Utilizes regular expressions to match user input patterns and respond accordingly.

Basic Error Handling: The chatbot can manage unrecognized inputs by providing default responses, enhancing user experience.

# Implementation Details
1.Setting Up the Environment:

Installed necessary libraries: pip install nltk

Imported required modules:

# import nltk

# import re

2.Text Preprocessing:

Tokenized sentences and words to break down user inputs.
Removed stopwords to focus on significant words.

3.Response Generation:

Defined a set of predefined responses for common greetings and queries.
Used pattern matching to identify keywords and generate relevant responses.

4.Main Chatbot Function:

Created a loop to continuously prompt user input and generate responses until the user decides to end the conversation.
